- You will no longer get the "you have no idea who Parsee is talking about" line for Unzan if you've met Ichirin, Alice's dolls if you've met Alice, Myon if you've met Youmu, or Rinnosuke

BUG FIXES
- Kogasa's bridge scene now gives her Favorability instead of Parsee
- Parsee will no longer react multiple times to you raping her in stopped time
- Parsee's milking scene will no longer display with less than 1500 Favorability

0.1.33 - October 21, 2023
NEW FEATURES
- Parsee will now nail you (pun intended) with the ushi no toki mairi curse if you rape her in time stop and she knows you can stop time. Fortunately, she only does it once instead of every night like she does if you break up with her twice.

BUG FIXES
- Parsee now loses all her Fear, Loyalty, Submission, and Favor gems when you rape her in time stop and she knows you can stop time, so now she doesn't get all her Intimacy and Obedience back the next day (thanks for reporting this, Sophodot!)

NEW FEATURES

BUG FIXES

- Fixed Parsee saying "daeva" and "daevas" instead of "div" and "div-ha"

- Added a conversation about Koishi
- Added an option to configure what kind of domme you'd like Parsee to be when she has the initiative in Hashihime Services (requested by Lesbian Fujoshi)

BUG FIXES
All of these bugs were found by Sophodot unless otherwise specified.
- Double-checked all of Parsee's commands to make sure she isn't speaking if time is stopped, she's sleeping, or she's wasted [todo]
- Double-checked Parsee's dialogue to make sure lines weren't being skipped because of RETURN statements in the wrong places (found by me) [todo]
- Fixed some SELECTCASE RAND: conditions that had cases that could never display (me)
- Fixed two bugs relating to her tavern events: one where they triggered if she was at the bridge and not the tavern, and one where she got an extra 500 drunkenness every time you met her at the bridge
- Replaced Parsee's vaginal sex counter with a counter that counts how many times you've pushed her down or she's been pushed down while conscious (a bunch of the vaginal sex counter increments weren't happening because they were behind IF LOCAL:1 checks) (me)
- Moved the lines for Parsee undressing to their own functions to make the code slightly more readable (me)
- Expanded Parsee's work info to show that she only works on weekdays
- Fixed Parsee's "won't confess to you flag" not being set correctly

- Fixed a bug where the penalty that was supposed to apply for dating Yuugi in front of her checked Kosuzu's ID instead (me)
- Made it clear that Parsee loses all her hate marks if you lose to her in a Danmaku match, and added a few hints about that feature if she has Hate Marks
- Made Parsee's Embrace lines no longer display if you have 5 or fewer Intimacy (because it doesn't make sense for her to push you away in the generic text and then hug you back in her actual lines) (me)
- Made Parsee no longer enter the Tsundere Attitude if she's angry or has a Hate Mark because too many of the lines assume she knows she's crushing on you, and she hasn't realized that yet if she doesn't have Yearning (me)
- Typo fixes (Sophodot, Elly, me)
- Removed a debug line from the "break up with a lover" command
- Fixed a few bugs where Parsee didn't react properly to you trying to break up with her
- Added a missing MORELOVER check to the "can't push Parsee down if you're dating one of her friends" code
- Moved Parsee's hatefuck lines around so the "I know I had a paru paru meltdown at you when you tried to push me down but I want to fuck you anyway" lines take priority over the "I hate you so I'm going to fuck you until you can't walk" lines (me)
- Added a debug statement in Parsee's bio that shows what version of the dialogue she's on (me)
- Moved the "change Parsee's traits when she becomes a lover" code to a separate function and fixed a bug where it displayed the wrong trait name when showing what traits changed
- Tweaked Parsee's meltdown event so she runs back to her house if it happened outside her room and kicks you out of her room otherwise, made it so it takes priority over the "you're dating one of my friends, asshole" event if you're dating Yuugi (since she has special lines for that), and made it cancel leading around (me)[X]
- Made it so seeing her meltdown event puts her in the Tsundere attitude if she hasn't gotten to a fall state yet (me)
- Fixed Parsee's text for accepting her confession not displaying
- Fixed the scene when meeting Parsee after she falls in love with you not displaying (me)
- Fixed Parsee's unprotected sex related lines not displaying (me)

- Fixed Parsee's Lust Route info showing in her bio when it wasn't supposed to (found by Anon)
- Removed the "you're cheating on your lover" lines because I'd need to check and see which hus don't care about being cucked, plus it was buggy anyway (Anon)
- Fixed a bug where Parsee's Hate Mark 3 date reaction reset her hate marks to 1 (Anon)
- Fixed Parsee's skills not being adjusted properly if you chose to adjust them (JukesBouver99)
- Fixed push down lines not displaying (me)
- Fixed Parsee speaking during the Sleep Together command if she's asleep
- Fixed her contraception function getting called 10% of the time instead of 90% of the time, and made it so she won't do it if it's not a dangerous day and she's consented to unprotected sex on non-dangerous days (me)
- Fixed Parsee mentioning you while masturbating even if you haven't met her, and mentioning having sex with you while masturbating even if you can't fuck her (Anon)

- Fixed some other lines of text that weren't getting displayed due to bugs

- Fixed Parsee talking at the beginning and end of a sleep rape
- Fixed the "Secluded Spot" command calling the "take a contraceptive" function even if the pushdown attempt failed (me)
- Fixed the "can't push Parsee down if you're dating one of her friends" function not returning properly if Parsee had already given you her consent (it was checking LOCAL instead of RETURN) (me)
- Fixed the "you recieve Parsee's consent" message showing up every time you got her a gift nice enough that she's willing to let you fuck her
- Fixed several edge case interactions with Parsee's "too jealous to fuck you" and "won't cuck her friends" mechanics (me)
- Fixed Parsee's first diary entry repeating 30+ times before you could get to her other entries (me)
