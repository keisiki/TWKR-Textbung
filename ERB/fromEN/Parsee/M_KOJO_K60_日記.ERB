;→未読フラグ(2)が立っていると一日の終わりにデイリーイベントとして日記が読まれる（既読になる）。
;→※２未読フラグ(3)が立っていると[日記を読む]で読む事ができる。読むと既読(1)になる。
;※１各所イベント口上やコマンド口上でフラグを立たせても良いです。
;※２基本的には未読(2)推奨です。既読(1)、未読(3)はワンステップ必要。

;[日記を読む]には、持ち主が[연모]なら自由に読むことができ、
;そうでない場合は恋慕でない人物がその場に居ない時、もしくは時間停止することで盗み読みできる。
;拠点住民でないキャラは恋慕であれば自宅（초대방）で読むことができる。

;常時チェックされる日記の状態情報。
;ここでDIARY:[[파르시]]:YYの更新を行う。
;※DIARY:[[파르시]]:0番は使えません。

;ここで汎用発生条件を記入する
;コマンド別の発生条件はM_KOJOの各ファイル中で追加してください。

;基本的に発生条件には"DIARY:[[파르시]]:YY == 0"を入れること。
;そうしないと同じ日記が書かれたりしてしまう。

;DIARY:[[파르시]]:YY　　　　キャラ番号XXの日記番号YYの情報
;　　 3=未読　　　　デイリーイベントで読まれない。[日記を読む]で読むと既読になる。
;　　 2=未読　　　　デイリーイベントで読まれる。読まれるまでは[日記を読む]では読めない。読まれると既読になる。
;　　 1=既読　　　　デイリーイベントで読まれない。[日記を読む]で読める。
;　　 0=読めない　　未解禁。

;○未読(2)にする場合（基本）
;未読(2)にするとデイリーイベントとして発生し、一日の終わりに１つだけ読まれる。
;複数のページが未読(2)になっている場合は番号が小さいものが読まれ、それ以外はリセット(0)される。
;その為、複数同時に発生すると、発生したのに読まれずリセットされる場合もある。
;未読(2)にするには単純にフラグに2を入れるだけで良い。

;例１)初対面
;SIF DIARY:[[파르시]]:YY == 0 && CFLAG:[[파르시]]:안면
;	DIARY:[[파르시]]:YY = 2

;○未読(3)にする場合（応用）
;未読(3)にするとデイリーイベントとして読まれず、書かれた時点で[日記を読む]によって読めるようになる。
;プレイヤーが自主的に読まない限り読まれず、一日に複数ページ加筆される場合もある。
;未読(3)にするにはフラグに3を入れた上で、CALL CHARA_DIARY_PAGESETTING([[파르시]], YY)をする必要がある。

;例２）好感度100以上
;IF DIARY:[[파르시]]:YY == 0 && CFLAG:[[파르시]]:호감도 >= 100
;	DIARY:[[파르시]]:YY = 3
;	CALL CHARA_DIARY_PAGESETTING([[파르시]], YY)
;ENDIF

;例３）例２の日記が読まれた上で好感度1000以上
;これをするとYYを読んだ直後にZZが書き込まれることも起こる。
;IF DIARY:[[파르시]]:ZZ == 0 && DIARY:[[파르시]]:YY == 1 && CFLAG:[[파르시]]:호감도 >= 1000
;	DIARY:[[파르시]]:ZZ = 3
;	CALL CHARA_DIARY_PAGESETTING([[파르시]], ZZ)
;ENDIF

;▽おせっかいな注釈
;ファーストキスは基本的に全員[키스미경험]を所持しているので、"!TALENT:[[파르시]]:키스미경험"で判定できます。
;デート帰りのキスで分岐したいならデート帰りのキス口上でフラグを立てます。
;その場合、通常のファーストキス喪失と重複しないように気をつけましょう。
;処女喪失は初期設定で処女喪失している場合もあるので、処女喪失口上の方でフラグを立てた方が良いです。
;その他告白・陥落等のイベントは各種イベント口上でフラグを立てます。初対面はそっちでも大丈夫です。
;日付を正確に測るには別途フラグが必要です。例えば初めて会った日とか。

PRINTFORMDL - The Journal of %NAME:60%  Pg.{PAGECOUNT}--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINTL

;※PAGENUM:0は使えません
SELECTCASE PAGENUM
	CASE 1
		PRINTFORML Well, I finally did it. I bought myself a diary.
		PRINTFORML Although I suppose it's more like a journal. What would I even write in a normal diary?
		PRINTFORML 「Nothing much happened on the bridge today. Went out drinking with Yuugi.\@ CFLAG:[[파르시]]:K60ENC_SETTING_YUUPARU_CRUSH == 1 ?  Wanted to confess to her but didn't.#\@」
		PRINTFORML 「Saw a bunch of people I was jealous of. Went home and seethed for a while. Paruparuparuparu.」
		PRINTFORML 「I hate myself.」
		PRINTFORML It would just be the same things over and over. No, I'm going to use this to blow off steam.
		PRINTFORML My anger, my jealousy, my self-hatred... I'm going to write about it here. Maybe it'll make me feel better.
		PRINTFORML At least I won't be burdening anyone else with my insufferable whining.

	CASE 2
		PRINTFORML I want sex, and yet... I don't.
		PRINTFORML On the one hand, of course I want sex. Who doesn't? I certainly have an active enough libido.
		PRINTFORML More importantly, I want sex because it's one less thing to be jealous of.
		PRINTFORML Kisume, Yamame, Yuugi... even Satori. They're attractive, they're charming, they're hundreds of years old...
		PRINTFORML I'd be very surprised if any of them are virgins.
		PRINTFORML In fact, I'd be very surprised if any youkai (other than myself, the fairies, and other childish youkai like Rumia) are virgins.
		PRINTFORML Rumia and the fairies probably don't even know what sex is. I'm fairly certain Rumia thinks kissing can make you pregnant.
		PRINTFORML But the rest of us?
		PRINTFORML Never mind hundreds of years old, Lady Yakumo is older than Gensokyo itself. There's no way she hasn't slept with someone at least once.
		PRINTFORML I have excuses, of course.
		PRINTFORML First I was too busy with my job for romance, and then nobody came across my bridge for me to flirt with...
		PRINTFORML But I can't lie to myself forever. I could have looked for love in the Old Capital. \@ CFLAG:[[파르시]]:K60ENC_SETTING_YUUPARU_CRUSH == 1 ? Maybe I could've even grown a spine and confessed to Yuugi. #\@
		PRINTFORML I could have. But I didn't even try. I was too afraid of rejection.
		PRINTFORML Just thinking about someone trying to touch me makes me freeze up.
		PRINTFORML What if they hate it? What if they recoil in disgust as soon as they touch my skin?
		PRINTFORML What if I'm too tense, or too inexperienced, and they abandon me and find some other, normal %PRINT_MALE("guy", TARGET)% instead?
		PRINTFORML There are just too many things that could go wrong. And I'm so incompetent that I'm sure they would go wrong.
		PRINTFORML I can deal with being ignored, but I can't deal with being mocked.
		PRINTFORML And even if I somehow did manage to lose my virginity without that happening, it wouldn't actually make me feel any better about myself.
		PRINTFORML For one, I would still feel jealous of all the people who lost their virginities sooner.
		PRINTFORML But most importantly... it's not really sex I want so much as intimacy.
		PRINTFORML Someone wanting my body is all well and good, but it's not enough. I want to know that they like me as a person.
		PRINTFORML And that's absurd. I don't even like myself. Why would anyone else?
		PRINTFORML So that's why I don't want sex or romance. I can pretend that it's not that I can't get it, it's that I don't desire it at all.
		PRINTFORML In fact, I can pretend that it's a point of pride. Other youkai give in to their animal lusts, but not me. I can control myself.
		PRINTFORML I don't need anyone else. I can be happy by myself. Pure, untouched Parsee Mizuhashi, who's just so much better than the rest of you.
		PRINTFORML I can pretend, but only for so long. Sooner or later, reality creeps back in.

	CASE 3
		PRINTFORML What's wrong with me?
		PRINTFORML I was tossing and turning all night because I couldn't stop thinking about how jealous I was of Satori.
		PRINTFORML And once I finally drifted off, I woke up four hours later and immediately started brooding about how jealous of her I am again.
		PRINTFORML Now I'm sitting at my desk at eight in the morning writing in my journal because I hope that getting this off my chest will allow me to sleep.
		PRINTFORML Why? Why won't she get out of my head?
		PRINTFORML Why can't I just get over her and how nobody can beat her at anything? Why can't I stop obsessing over this?!
		PRINTFORML I just want it to stop. I just want my mind to leave me alone.

	CASE 4
		PRINTFORML I hate this. I hate living like this.
		PRINTFORML I hate the surge of anger I feel whenever I look at another person, because how dare they have something, anything, that I don't?
		PRINTFORML I hate knowing how irrational it is, and how they don't deserve my anger.
		PRINTFORML I hate feeling angry anyway.
		PRINTFORML I hate how it feels to be jealous.
		PRINTFORML I hate feeling that pressure in my temples and at the back of my head, like my head is locked in a vise and someone is slowly tightening it.
		PRINTFORML I hate the cold, clammy feeling that sweeps over me, like my insides have turned to ice and they're starting to melt.
		PRINTFORML I hate how I feel the urge to run away just to make it stop, and I hate knowing that your feelings aren't things you can run away from.
		PRINTFORML I hate how humiliated people make me feel just by being better than me.
		PRINTFORML I hate the feeling of disgust and despair that sweeps over me when I see them.
		PRINTFORML I hate how I feel like I have no reason to exist when they're so much better at everything than I am.
		PRINTFORML I hate how sometimes I get so enraged that it feels like I'm not even myself anymore. Like I'm someone else, watching myself get angry.
		PRINTFORML I hate how I keep obsessively brooding about whatever they did to make me jealous.
		PRINTFORML I hate how it keeps popping back into my mind even when I don't want it to.
		PRINTFORML I hate remembering how every day for years and years and years has been like this, and every day of the rest of my life will be like this too.
		PRINTFORML I hate remembering that I wasn't always like this.
		PRINTFORML And most of all, I hate knowing that my misery is my own damn fault.

	CASE 5
		PRINTFORML I don't know why I bother writing in this stupid thing.
		PRINTFORML It helps to blow off steam for a little while, but then something else happens to ruin my day and I have to write about it, too.
		PRINTFORML At this rate, I'm going to spend the rest of my life writing diary entries.
		PRINTFORML And that's assuming that writer's block doesn't get to me. I only write about the same things over and over.
		PRINTFORML 「I hate myself. I hate everyone. Everyone hates me. I'm sad. I'm jealous. I'm walking garbage. Whine whine whine.」
		PRINTFORML There's only so much I can whine about before I start repeating myself.
		PRINTFORML Maybe I should just burn this. I don't plan on rereading my old entries, and nobody else is ever going to read them.

	CASE 6
		PRINTFORML Sometimes I wonder who I really am.
		PRINTFORML There are at least two Parsee Mizuhashis. There's the Parsee I pretend to be, around my victims.
		PRINTFORML Cheerful, friendly, outgoing. Normal. But everything %HE_SHE(TARGET)% says is always a put-down or a backhanded compliment.
		PRINTFORML Every word carefully chosen to spark jealousy in my victim so I can feed on them like the parasite I am.
		PRINTFORML Then there's the Parsee I really am. Bitter, self-pitying, cruel, full of rage...
		PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(TARGET,1)% resents everyone and everything, %HIM_HER(TARGET)%self most of all.
		CALL PRINT_STRL, @"「And %HE_SHE(TARGET)%'s consumed by jealousy. That's @ITALIC@why@ I resent everyone.」"
		PRINTFORML They're all so much better than I am, and constantly being reminded of that hurts.
		PRINTFORML But sometimes I think about that strange thing that Satori told me.
		PRINTFORML "You're too hard on yourself, Parsee\@ IS_MALE([[파르시]]) ? -kun # -chan\@.
		PRINTFORML Deep down, you value and respect the people you're jealous of."
		PRINTFORML At the time I assumed she was just trying to flatter me so I didn't go on a rampage or something...
		PRINTFORML But I wasn't always a hashihime. I used to be a guardian spirit, long ago.
		CALL PRINT_STRL, @"So long ago I can't even remember when I @ITALIC@stopped@ being one."
		PRINTFORML What was I like, back then? Who was the third Parsee Mizuhashi?
		PRINTFORML Was she the real me? If so, am I doomed to be some kind of fake Parsee for the rest of my life?
		PRINTFORML I don't know. I don't want to think about those days. I don't want to think about what I've lost.
		PRINTFORML I'm already jealous of everyone and everything. I don't think I could handle being jealous of myself.

	CASE 7
		PRINTFORML I don't know what I believe anymore.
		PRINTFORML I recite a creed five times a day that says I'm a Zoroastrian and a worshipper of Lord Ohrmazd... but am I really?
		PRINTFORML I don't remember the last time he spoke to me. Did he ever speak to me at all?
		PRINTFORML Ever since I came to this land, I've seen plenty of "gods", and even a Christian angel, but no izad-ha.
		PRINTFORML I suppose that might be a good thing. Gensokyo is a refuge for those that have been forgotten.
		PRINTFORML And how could the true god and his angels ever be forgotten?
		PRINTFORML I know this, but I can't help but doubt.
		PRINTFORML The main thing that keeps me going is stubbornness, really.
		PRINTFORML Becoming a Taoist or a Shinto practitioner would be an admission that I've been living a lie for centuries.
		PRINTFORML And it would be an act of betrayal.
		PRINTFORML The Parsis fled to India from Persia to escape persecution, even though they could have just abandoned their faith.
		PRINTFORML How can I abandon mine?
		PRINTFORML I wish there was a dastet I could talk to about these things, but I'm the only Zoroastrian in Gensokyo.
		PRINTFORML The only way I would ever be able to speak to one is to bribe the gap hag to take me to the Outside World and back again...
		PRINTFORML And I don't have anything to bribe her with. Only mediocre paintings and empty sake bottles.

	CASE 8
		PRINTFORML Damn it, it happened again.
		PRINTFORML That's the fourth time now. Someone starts hanging around me, I somehow fail to drive them off with my rotten personality...
		PRINTFORML And before I know it, I realize I'm starting to enjoy having them around.
		PRINTFORML It happened with Yamame, with Kisume, with Yuugi... and now with %CALLNAME:MASTER%.
		CALL PRINT_STRL, @"Well, it's too late to drive %HIM_HER(MASTER)% off @ITALIC@now@."
		PRINTFORML Anyone foolish enough to befriend a hashihime isn't going to listen if I tell them "go away you idiot, I'm only going to hurt you".
		PRINTFORML And besides... I like %HIM_HER(MASTER)%. I know it's selfish, but I do.
		PRINTFORML I like talking with %HIM_HER(MASTER)%. I like fishing with %HIM_HER(MASTER)%. I like going out for drinks with %HIM_HER(MASTER)%.
		PRINTFORML And somehow, %CALLNAME:MASTER% likes doing these things with me.
		PRINTFORML Or maybe %HE_SHE(MASTER)% just pities me, and %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s a very talented actor? I don't know.
		PRINTFORML ...I'm so jealous of people who can actually treat their friends right.

	CASE 9
		PRINTFORML I hate %CALLNAME:MASTER%.
		PRINTFORML I hate that I can't stop obsessing over %HIM_HER(MASTER)%.
		PRINTFORML I've been jealous of hundreds, if not thousands of other people before, and none of them have gotten under my skin like this.
		PRINTFORML （And that's another thing that I'm jealous of. That %HE_SHE(MASTER)%, of all people, is capable of affecting me like this without even trying.）
		PRINTFORML It's not just that %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s so good at so many things, from playing an instrument to fishing to cooking to gathering herbs.
		PRINTFORML It's not just %HIS_HER(MASTER)% romantic success, although that's certainly a major part of it.

		PRINTFORML It's not just the fact that %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s somehow become the most important person in Gensokyo when I wasn't looking...

		PRINTFORML They weren't given to %HIM_HER(MASTER)%, like my long lifespan or my physical strength or my hashihime powers.
		PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% earned them. %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% worked %HIS_HER(MASTER)% fingers to the bone and %HIS_HER(MASTER)% hard work paid off.
		PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% started out from nothing and worked to improve %HIM_HER(MASTER)%self.
		PRINTFORML I started from nothing, and now I'm a bitter, lonely bridgekeeper who everyone hates. Hardly an improvement.
		PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% is a living, breathing reminder that my problems are all my own fault.

		PRINTFORML That's the irony of this whole situation. I've seen this kind of obsessive jealous hatred before. Nurtured it. Fed on it.
		PRINTFORML And now I'm on the receiving end. That's the thing I hate the most... that all of this is just me getting what I deserve.

		CALL PRINT_STRL, @"That's insane. I'm a hashihime. I eat, sleep, and breathe jealousy. In fact, I @ITALIC@literally@ eat jealousy."
		PRINTFORML Not feeling jealousy is like... I don't know, a human not feeling the need to breathe.
		PRINTFORML Then again, the stories say that hashihime are born from jealous women who've had their hearts broken. Maybe falling in love makes us... better?
		PRINTFORML But no. I can't be with %HIM_HER(MASTER)%.
		PRINTFORML I've been too toxic for too long. I don't know how to interact with people without trying to make them miserable.
		PRINTFORML I know how this is going to go.
		PRINTFORML Sooner or later, %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s going to get sick of me (and who could blame %HIM_HER(MASTER)%?).
		PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)%'s going to break up with me and find someone better (not that that's hard).
		PRINTFORML No, there's no point in putting %HIM_HER(MASTER)% through that. %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% deserves to be with someone who can treat %HIM_HER(MASTER)% right.
		PRINTFORML That's what I tell myself. I know, intellectually, that I am too toxic to be in a relationship with %CALLNAME:MASTER%.
		PRINTFORML But every time %HE_SHE(MASTER)% comes by and offers me tea, or helps me guard the bridge, or just talks to me...

		PRINTFORML Maybe I should pretend I've been hit on the head and can't remember how to speak Japanese anymore?
		PRINTFORML I would have to cut off Kisume, Yamame, and Yuugi, but that would be for the best. They're better off that way.

		PRINTFORML I've lost everything I used to have. My bridge, my old home... even my species. All of it has been stripped from me over the years.
		PRINTFORML My faith and my culture are the only remnants of my old life. If I lose them... I won't know who I am any longer.
		PRINTFORML Even worse, it'll mean I've accepted who I am now. A bitter, broken hashihime with no purpose and no future.
