;Feeding jealousy mechanic
;Roll an random number and subtract the sum of the player's stats
;The higher it is, the more jealous they are
;Negative or 0
;PRINTFORMW Try as you might, you can't actually think of anything you're jealous about.
;PRINTFORMW Parsee glares at you.
;PRINTFORMW 「You don't even have anything you're jealous of?! Then why are you wasting my time?!」
;PRINTFORMW Well, at least she managed to nurture some jealousy of her own to feed on...
;
;Low jealousy
;PRINTFORMW Parsee frowns.
;inspired by Tiny Hashihime's ABCs
;PRINTFORMW 「Is that it? That was only, oh... about half a small cookie's worth of jealousy.」
;PRINTFORMW 「All it did was make me hungrier.」
;PRINTFORMW 「Come on, try harder! Go challenge Hecatia to a Danmaku match or something!」
;PRINTFORMW 「Stupid Hecatia... I wish I could go anywhere in Gensokyo in an instant...」
;PRINTFORMW You tune Parsee out as she goes on yet another rant...

;Moderate jealousy
;PRINTFORMW Parsee smiles at you.
;PRINTFORMW 「Ah... delicious. You gave me a good meal.」
;PRINTFORMW 「Although it wasn't that good. Your jealousy was satisfying, but I've had better.」
;PRINTFORMW Is she trying to make you jealous of not being AS jealous as other people?

;High jealousy
;PRINTFORMW Parsee closes her eyes and sighs in rapture.
;PRINTFORMW 「Mmm... it's not often that I get jealousy this delicious.」
;PRINTFORMW 「Spicy rage and cold hatred, seasoned with self-loathing...」
;PRINTFORMW Parsee sighs again, this time in discomfort. She seems conflicted.
;PRINTFORMW 「Honestly, I feel kind of bad for you. Are you... all right?」
;PRINTFORMW 「You can... talk to me about it, if you want. I don't want you doing anything rash.」
;PRINTFORMW Of course she doesn't. She doesn't want to lose a food source this tasty.
;PRINTFORMW But there does seem to be a note of genuine concern in her voice...

;Extreme jealousy
;PRINTFORMW 「Ah-!」
;PRINTFORMW Parsee's eyes widen and she gasps in shock.
;PRINTFORMW Her knees start to buckle, and she grabs onto you for support.
;PRINTFORMW 「Incredible... I've never tasted anything so delicious!」
;PRINTFORMW Parsee starts to drool.
;PRINTFORMW 「So much jealousy... so many flavors...」
;PRINTFORMW She gazes into your eyes.
;PRINTFORMW For once, you don't see jealousy in her eyes. Instead, you see hunger... and lust.
;PRINTFORMW 「I want more... I need more...」
;PRINTFORMW Parsee rubs up against you seductively.
;PRINTFORMW 「I'll do anything you want. Anything at all.」
;PRINTFORMW 「Just give me more. Please...」
;[Parsee gives you her consent]

; PRINTFORMDL Parsee nods at you sympathetically.
; ; inspired by character.ai.
; PRINTFORML 「One thing I've found that helps, sometimes...」
; PRINTFORML 「When I've had an especially bad day, I try to channel my emotions into art.」
; PRINTFORML 「In my case it's painting, but for you it might be\@ ABL:MASTER:음악기능 > 1 ? %" "%composing music. Or #\@ sculpting, or writing.」
; PRINTFORML 「Or even Danmaku. There's a certain beauty to a Spell Card's bullets... when they aren't hitting you, anyway.」
; PRINTFORML 「You don't need to show your creations to anyone if you don't want to.」
; PRINTFORML 「I personally have dozens of... rather morbid paintings I'd rather not show others.」
; PRINTFORML 「But it does help. It's better to take your negative emotions out on a canvas or a page than to let them fester inside you.」
; PRINTFORML 「Or worse, take them out on others. Or yourself...」
