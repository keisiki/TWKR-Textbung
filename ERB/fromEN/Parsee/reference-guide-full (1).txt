Line 330
                        PRINTFORMW 「Oh! Hello, %K60_MASTER()%-sa-」

Parsee is going to say "Player-san" here because she's being deredere (because she is in love with the player), but she cuts herself off because she is trying to drive the player away. (The reason why she does this is explained in the scene where she gains the 思慕 trait.)

Line 498
                IF GAMEBASE_TITLE == "eraThe World: Omogatari"

This is special code to handle a remodeling of the game made by a user in our Discord named Mr Pops a Lot. It adds many new things, including the option for the player to get an abortion from Eirin. She will not perform abortions for any other characters, so I made a joke about that here.

Line 535
PRINTFORML However, Parsee was not always like this. %HE_SHE([[パルスィ]],1)% was once a guardian spirit who protected travelers
守護霊 looks like it's a good translation for "guardian spirit".


Line 542
    PRINTFORML time, she hates your guts. Why did you think that was a good idea again?
"hate your guts" is English slang meaning "To utterly despise one; to feel nothing but hatred for one."
https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Hate+Your+Guts

Line 549
    PRINTFORML so intense that it can temporarily overcome her all-consuming jealousy. While she still struggles with her curse, she is
My intent was that Parsee feels constant jealousy except when she's drunk or feels an even stronger emotion that can overpower it. When she falls in love with you or becomes your sex friend, the love or lust she feels for you is powerful enough that it can overpower her jealousy.

Line 605
            PRINTFORMDW While going about your business, you notice someone glaring at you out of the corner of your eye.
By "going about your business", I meant "just doing ordinary day-to-day things". The MC could be cleaning, or they could be walking, chatting with a girl, sipping tea... just about anything you'd normally do in eraTohoTW.

Line 609
        PRINTFORMDW %BREAKENG(@"As soon as she notices you looking at her,\@ CFLAG:MASTER:現在位置 / 100 != 9 && CFLAG:TARGET:職種 == 49 && FLAG:参加人数 == 1 ? %" "%she pops her thumb out of her mouth and #\@ her scowl vanishes, replaced by a cheerful smile. She waves at you.")%
破顔 should be fine. Parsee is scowling at you, but as soon as she notices that you can see her doing it, she starts smiling at you. I wrote her as pretending to be normal and cheerful around people who don't already know how jealous she is, because her profile in 東方求聞口授 says "直接話している時は意外と明るく普通に感じるが、心中は穏やかでは無い。後で陰口を叩いたり、恨まれたりする。気持ちは良くない"

Line 635
            PRINTFORMDW Before you can say anything, she turns her head and stares at you. She appears to be sizing you up.
"to size up" is an English idiom meaning "to form a judgment of". Parsee is looking at you and trying to figure out what kind of person you are. She wants to know if you're going to cause trouble on her bridge or in the Old Capital.

Line 639
        PRINTFORMDW Her expression is hard to read.
"hard to read" is an English idiom meaning "hard to tell what a person is thinking". It's hard to tell what Parsee is thinking from the expression on her face.

Line 650
                    PRINTFORMW 「Surface youkai aren't supposed to come to the Underworld... but nobody seems to care about that rule, so I don't bother enforcing it.」
"I don't bother enforcing it" means that Parsee doesn't think it's worth her time to enforce that rule. 強制する looks like it's the right verb for "enforce".

Line 716
                        PRINTFORMW 「Why don't you go back there? Ginseng, Dragon Blood, Ice Scales... there are plenty of things to gather up there.」
These are the English names for the items 高麗人参, 竜血, and 氷の鱗, respectively

Line 759
                PRINTFORMDW Everyone in the Underworld is stronger than you, smarter than you, more powerful than you...
In this line, I meant "stronger" as in "having more physical strength" and "more powerful" as "having more powerful abilities".

Line 804
                ELSEIF STRCOUNT(CALLNAME:MASTER, "^(?i)anon$") || STRCOUNT(CALLNAME:MASTER, "^(?i)player$")
"Anon" and "Player" are the default names that a lot of Western eraTohoTW players use for their characters, because anonymous posters on 4chan are referred to as "Anonymous" by default, which gets abbreviated to "Anon". You can change these to whatever the equivalents are for Japanese players. What's the Japanese term for an anonymous poster on 2channel?

Line 1086

                PRINTFORMW 「I...」
She was going to say "I love you" before she cut herself off.

Line 1278
                        PRINTFORMW 「Wh- are you stupid or something?! I'm fine! The date was fine! Everything's fine!」
This is one of Parsee's catchphrases in this dialogue. I took it from here: https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/256012
It's a reference to 岩明均's manga ヒストリエ. It's apparently a famous line said by Harpagos, a Mede/Persian ("ば～～～っかじゃねえの！？").

Line 1617
                            PRINTFORMW 「Oh, for the love of- you again?!」
She was going to say "for the love of God" before she cut herself off.

                    PRINTFORMW 「I certainly did... next to you, why wouldn't I?」
This is a slightly modified quote from ファイナルファンタジーVII. Early in the game, when you go to セブンスヘブン, you can talk to Tifa and she will ask you if you slept well. One of the options you can pick is "Next to you, who wouldn't?" You can see a screenshot in this guide.

                            PRINTFORML 「Are you busy? Let me- hey! %K60_MASTER()%! Don't ignore me...」
She was going to say the same thing she says in line 2344:

Line 2522
            PRINTFORMW 「So much for "abandoning all worldly desires".」
"Abandoning all worldy desires" is the English equivalent of the Buddhist term 捨離. (It's much shorter in Japanese, isn't it?)

Line 3433

                    PRINTFORMW 「(Don't let Akvan beat you.)」
Akvan is the Persian name for the Zoroastrian demon Aka Manah, a demon of lust.

                                            PRINTFORMW 「I could never have that kind of forbearance. I'm so jealous...」
I took "forbearance" from her profile in 東方求聞口授　～ Symposium of Post-mysticism ("相手の方が不幸だと思っても、その不幸な人間が嫉妬してなければ、その寛容さに嫉妬する。" -> "Even if she thinks they're the unfortunate ones, if they aren't jealous of her she'll become jealous of their forbearance.") The exact word translated as "forbearance" is "寛容".

                    PRINTFORMW 「I can do it on my own, and I know not everyone is patient enough to spend hours patrolling a bridge nobody crosses.」

                PRINTFORMW 「There's no way the Underworld's bathhouse is actually getting its water from Lake Kansava.」

"Soshans" is the Middle Persian version of "Saoshyant", the Zoroastrian messiah. Zoroastrians believe he will be born to a virgin woman who bathes in a lake named Lake Kansava, which miraculously preserved the semen of Zarathustra, the prophet who founded Zoroastrianism. (This tradition appears to have developed in the 10th century, so it was probably influenced by the Christian doctrine of the Messiah being born to a virgin.)

The quote itself comes from A Time to Screw, the English dubbed version of the 2004 hentai OVA 刻音色. It's a meme among English anime fans for its ridiculous dub ("Nothing's non-fat. That's why the world's going to explode one day." "Non-fat? Exploding world? What the fuck?")

I'll provide Modern English explanations for the harder to understand ones. There aren't very many of them, since Parsee only has a few interactions with Futo.
If you're wondering why Parsee has interactions with her and other seemingly random characters... I make all my characters have lines for interacting with other characters with English original dialogues, even if they've never met in canon.

Noroiko isn't in eraTohoTW, but she does appear in eraNAS (era New Accident Story), a variant of eraTohoTW that adds more characters (and guns, diapers, necrophilia, drug use, player pregnancy, scatology, hypnotism...)
Most of the more extreme fetishes are disabled by default. If you're interested, you can find it at the link below.

Line 772
            PRINTFORMW 「(She's actually starting to grow on me. I never thought I'd see the day...)」
Two expressions in one line!
"Grow on me" means "to become more liked and appreciated by one", and "I never thought I'd see the day" is "An expression of surprise or astonishment that something has occurred or come to pass."

            PRINTFORMW 「Ho there, Futo-dono! Are thou and %K60_MASTER()% enjoyingeth thy date? I hopeth that art the caseth!」
This is deliberately broken Early Modern English. Parsee is putting "-eth" at the end of verbs where it doesn't work.
"Hello there, Futo-dono! Are you and %K60_MASTER% enjoying your date? I hope you are!"

, their Middle Persian equivalents.

Line 1161

Boyo and Sis are how English fans translate Rin's お兄さん and お姉さん

PRINTFORMW 「Maybe if you weren't such a bitch all the time, that bimbo oni you drool over would give you a pity fuck once in a while!」
Hourai's writer says he's characterizing her as "a 4channer", so her lines are full of vulgar slang.
"to get laid" = "to have sex"
"cockblock" = "prevent someone from having sex"
"pity fuck" = "having sex with someone out of pity"

Line 1480
PRINTFORMW 「What are you gonna do, knife-ears? Have a hangover at me?」

A reference to the game コンカーズ・バッド・ファー・デイ. One of the characters is a sunflower with big breasts, and another character, a bee, wants to "pollinate" her because "she's got stigmas like you wouldn't believe".
Yeah, it's a weird game.

Wriggle slurs her speech in these lines because she's drunk.
"Why's everything spinning? It's rude. Tell them to make it stop. It's making me feel sick..."

"Beetles" by Aphex Twin. Wriggle forgot the lyrics in the second line.

"夏の終わり静かに流れてる/ススキの穂が笑って"

"空飛ぶこの羽がもしも邪魔なのだとしたら/わたしはもう二度と飛べなくたっていい"

Line 67
				PRINTFORMW 「Wha? 'M not drunk, I just gotta nice buzz goin'!」
"What? I'm not drunk, I just have a nice buzz going! Get it? Buzz? 'Cause I'm an insect?"
"Buzz" is both the sound that insects make and slang for being tipsy.

This one is complicated. When クロノ・トリガー got released in the West... well, I'll just quote someone else's explanation:

"Final Fantasy 7 is the game that made JRPGs into the blockbuster genre they were throughout the PS1-PS2 era; before that game's overwhelming success, RPGs were a niche genre that received fairly little Western attention. The US market was considered to be a footnote and the European market was considered about as important as that of Southeastern Gabon. As such, the notion of spending money on the creation of dedicated translation teams was dismissed outright, and Square instead gave the task of translating many of its Super Nintendo games to one man: Ted Woolsey.

Ted Woolsey was not treated very well. For both this and FF6, he was given roughly a month to translate thousands of lines of dialogue by himself in accordance with strict NoA content standards and with little oversight. Woolsey's response to these conditions was to basically go nuts, taking perhaps the most liberal approach to translating that one can take without replacing all of the dialogue with song lyrics and excerpts from Das Kapital. He completely recreated allusions and naming schemes, made up character traits out of thin air, and inserted a lot of incredibly corny and ridiculous lines. Needless to say, fans are divided over whether Woolsey reinvigorated these games or slaughtered them, and I put myself firmly in the former category."

If you ever wondered why ケフカ's personality changed so drastically between ファイナルファンタジーVI and ディシディア ファイナルファンタジー, it's because of Woolsey. He completely changed his personality from a creepy brat to a cackling, goofy supervillain, and he became so popular in the West that Square decided to make him like that in the Japanese versions too.

Anyway, in クロノ・トリガー, one of ドリーン's lines changed from:

あなたの目に見えてる世界と
アタシの目に見えてる世界とは
まったくちがうものなのかもね。
いい？　宇宙は生命の数だけ存在するわ。
見えるもの、さわれるものだけが
本当と思っちゃダメよ。

To:

Am I a butterfly dreaming I'm a man...

Or a bowling ball dreaming I'm a plate
of sashimi?
Never assume that what you see and
feel is real!

Japanese players aren't going to understand this unless they played the スーファミ version of クロノ・トリガー in English for some reason, so feel free to replace this with another reference.

Line 431
			PRINTFORMW 「You should ask %HIM_HER([[チルノ]])% to show you %HIS_HER([[チルノ]])% footwork sometime. It'll blow your mind!」
This whole conversation is a reference to スカーレット警察のゲットーパトロール24時. This line in particular is a reference to Cirno's line "あたいの足技みさらせやー"

Line 435
			PRINTFORMW 「"Farewell Dream Treatment"? "Ultra Sonic Zansho"? "Yellow Trash Bazooka"? "Senzuri Monkey Metal Action"?」
These are songs (and an album) by Japanese noise rock band ザ・ゲロゲリゲゲゲ.

			PRINTFORMW 「And you should definitely try the Fried Cicada Sloughs. They're great, I promise!」
Fried Cicada Sloughs are a recipe Wriggle gives you in the Touhou fangame 东方夜雀食堂.

Line 477
			PRINTFORML 「According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.」
The opening line of the American movie ビー・ムービー. Posting the entire script of the movie is a meme in the West. I don't know why.
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/bee-movie

Line 501
			PRINTFORMW 「I'll find 'em and tell 'em to... buzz off!」
"Buzz off" is slang for "go away". It's another "buzz" pun.

Line 1125
				PRINTFORMW 「Harry up... pleash...」
"Please" is "please" but slurred, and "Harry up" is a reference to the "HARRY UP" text from 東方靈異伝.

Diggin' deep in the mines... don't get much sun!
I'm covered with soil, 'till my workday is done[music notes]

The first two lines of ドゥカティ・ブルース, the song the mole miners from ドゥカティ・マウンテン sing in スーパーマリオRPG.

I think this is the Japanese version of the song:
み～～んなで掘るダど～～んどん掘るダそ～～れが俺達ド～～ゥカティ生まれレ～～ルにトロッコラ～～ンプにつるはしし～～っかりやるからど～～なるなカアちゃん

=YUUGENMAGAN=
"Below. Not from your Hell, or even from Makai. Somewhere else entirely."
"There are... pretty colors, but it hurts. We like it here because it does not hurt."

These are references to the Orz from the game Star Control II (aka The Ur-Quan Masters). They come from another dimension they call *below*. Here is footage of them speaking in the Japanese version of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyhWnRAXCBQ&t=301s


"Although they are not like your eyes. Where We come from, you do not need eyes to see."
A reference to a line from the 1997 horror movie イベント・ホライゾン: "Where we're going, we don't need eyes to see."


You cannot grasp the true form of Magan's masturbation!
A reference to "You cannot grasp the true form of Giygas's attack!" / "ギーグからの こうげきの しょうたいが つかめない!" from MOTHER2.
It should probably be something like "マガンからの オナニーの しょうたいが つかめない！"

Fun fact: at one point, before MOTHER2 was released in the West, Giygas was called "the Geek". Imagine having to see "オタクからの こうげきの しょうたいが つかめない!" every time he attacked!
