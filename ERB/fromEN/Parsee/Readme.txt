For EraToho The World, Parsee Mizuhashi by Vinumsabbathi

v0.1.35 (December 28, 2023)

DISCLAIMER: There aren't any syntax errors, but I didn't test this dialogue too much. There will probably be bugs. Please report them so I can fix them.

If you want to contact me with contributions/bug reports/etc., join the Era Games General Discord and ping me. I'm Vinumsabbathi there, and the Discord link should be on the front page of the Era Games Wiki: https://wiki.eragames.rip/index.php/Main_Page

I'm also reading the ProLikeWhoa /hgg/, 4chan /jp/, and 4-ch.net /games/ Era games threads, and sometimes the shitaraba.net eratoho総合スレ (with Google Translate), so you can also post in one of them and I'll see it.

PLANS FOR THE NEXT UPDATE:
- Sex. More sex. Handjobs, vaginal sex, anal sex, finishing the paizuri lines, and also tribadism, Give Handjob, and some of the Catch Vaginal Sex commands for yuri and futa fans. Also some of the lewd counters, masturbation scenes (just the regular ones, not the "Lv 10+ Mouth Skill" ones), the Lewd [Body Part] acquisition scenes, and Horny Attitude lines for things that have lines for all the other attitudes.

FAQ:

Q. Why did Parsee go on a giant rant when I tried to push her down?
A. Not only is she extremely jealous of you, she suffers from violent mood swings and constantly self-sabotages. If you can get her to push you down at least once, she'll let you push her down going forward. She also won't do this if you get her to Sex Friend, Lust, Love, or Lover.

Q. How do I convince her to let me do it raw? She's always taking contraception!
A. She'll be too horny to remember if she's in heat. There's also a 10% chance she'll forget even if she isn't. And if all else fails, ask her directly from the Hashihime Services menu.

Q. Why won't Parsee confess to me?
A. She won't do it unless she's at Love, Sex Friend, or Lust. If she's at one of these fall states and she's still not confessing, it's a bug.

Q. Why won't Parsee push me down?
A.
    - Is she angry or at Hate Mark 3? Hus won't push you down if either of these are the case (you're just more likely to see it with Parsee because of her frequent menhera moments).
    - Is Kisume, Yamame, or Yuugi your lover, and is the More Lovers DLC disabled? Parsee won't cuck her friends.
    - If none of these are the case, it's probably a bug. Let me know so I can fix it.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Sometimes if you talk to Parsee, it won't actually print a conversation. I think this is fixed, but if it isn't, let me know
- Parsee can still embrace you even if you're dating one of her friends and the More Lovers DLC isn't enabled (I think this is a TW bug)
- Parsee's first undressing lines will never mention her underwear, because the game removes her underwear before it calls the undressing lines in the dialogue

About this

- I tried to blend Parsee's canon "acts nice but talks shit about you behind your back" and popular fanon "tsundere" personalities by making her start passive-aggressive, turning more     tsundere as she starts to develop feelings for you, and finally becoming genuinely nice to you once she reaches Love/Lust status. (Although she's still jealous of others, she just less so since she has you, and she tries to hide it for your sake. After all, Satori read her mind and said that she really was a kind person deep down...)

- She will still get jealous if you're hanging out with other 2hus, but try not to let it show because she trusts you.

- If you break that trust (by sleeping with another 2hu when Parsee is your lover), though... she will hate your guts. She will also hate your guts if you date her friends and then cheat on them in front of her.

- (Toggleable) If enabled, she will go full-on yandere too. (Not yet implemented)

- Here's a full explanation of the attitude system:

    Fake nice: This is how she acts if you haven't gotten her to a fall state, or if she's at Love and not your Lover. Symposium of Post-Mysticism says
    that Parsee "seems unexpectedly cheerful and normal when you talk to her directly, but what is going on in her heart is a completely different
    story. Afterward, she will talk about you behind your back, or start resenting you". This is that personality: cheerful enough, but sometimes she'll drop a
    backhanded compliment or passive-aggressive insult to stoke your jealousy so she can feed.

    Grumpy tsundere: This is how she acts if she's at Yearning/Sex Friend (and isn't at Love or Lust). It's basically how she's
    often portrayed in fan works: she's starting to like you but isn't happy about it (because she's worried that the two of you will just hurt one
    another), which makes her abrasive, sarcastic, and rude (and sometimes tender when her feelings show through). Very fun to write, but sometimes I feel like I should move half her lines t a fifth Angry attitude.

    Nice, horny: This is how she acts in Lust. Flirty, horny, and nice (but not quite as nice as Loving). Also will dom the shit out of you if you let her. Her fall dialogue mentions that sh's deliberately playing this up because she's worried that if she isn't like this you'll just leave her for someone sluttier (anyone with as much jealousy as her has got to have rock-bottom self-esteem), but this is probably the personality I'm least confident about my ability to write.

    Loving: This is how she acts when she's in Love and your Lover. Affectionate and nurturing, but
    sometimes needy, since she's still pretty insecure. (I might end up dropping the neediness if people think it would be better that way.)
- Parsee is extremely lonely but has trust issues.

- Parsee also has crippling self-esteem issues that she tries to hide by being passive-aggressive to people about their shortcomings.

- I tried to keep Parsee's background vague to avoid contradicting people's headcanons (and I was having trouble coming up with a timeline that made sense), but she is fluent in Persian and Gujarati (and can swear in Hindi, Arabic, Avestan, and Sanskrit), familiar with Indian, Gujarati, Persian, and Parsi culture, and several centuries old.

- One thing I did establish about her background is that she was never human. She was a former guardian spirit before transforming into a hashihime. (I got this from her Subterranean Animism profile, which doesn't mention anything about her being a former human.) Consequently, she never had a husband, and is a virgin (and very ashamed of it. Unless you set her as a non-virgin, in which case she's going through a centuries-long dry spell and is very ashamed of that instead).

- Parsee keeps her socks on during sex because that's hot. (Not yet implemented)

- Parsee has a crush on Yuugi, is friends with her, Kisume, and Yamame, dislikes Satori, Koishi, and the Buddhists (Buddhism regards the asuras as violent alcoholic gods, which Parsee, as a Zoroastrian, finds very offensive), LOATHES Shou (she's a devotee of Bishamonten, a deva. Daevas are demons in Zoroastrianism, so to Parsee she's basically a Satan worshipper), and distrusts everyone else due to her plethora of issues. It takes a lot of work to win her trust, but she will warm up to you once you have it.

- She will never cheat on you. Ever. There is no NTR in this dialogue, and there never will be.

- If she's at Lust, or if she's your lover and the More Lovers DLC is enabled, she'll arrange threesomes with you and her friends if you're OK with it. (Not yet implemented).

- I tried to write her as envious when not your lover and jealous when she is. To clarify, according to Wikipedia:

"John Rawls distinguishes between jealousy and envy on the ground that jealousy involves the wish to keep what one has, and envy the wish to get what one does not have.

The common experience of jealousy for many people may involve:

        Fear of loss
        Suspicion of or anger about a perceived betrayal
        Low self-esteem and sadness over perceived loss
        Uncertainty and loneliness
        Fear of losing an important person to another
        Distrust

The experience of envy involves:

        Feelings of inferiority
        Longing
        Resentment of circumstances
        Ill will towards envied person often accompanied by guilt about these feelings
        Motivation to improve
        Desire to possess the attractive rival's qualities
        Disapproval of feelings
        Sadness towards other's accomplishments"

Parsee is not a very happy person. After all, she's been stewing in her own jealousy, hatred, and self-loathing for decades now... that's not the kind of thing you can fix with a couple months of love and affection. (Although I might add an event where you can cure her of her jealousy and revert her back to a benevolent guardian spirit if she likes you enough... after all, TW is A Lighthearted Game(TM), and I feel bad for Parsee (which is why I started writefagging her in the first place)).

- Despite her manipulative and abrasive actions... underneath it all, Parsee is an unhappy, lonely woman who's in a lot of pain and has a self-loathing streak a mile wide. She needs a hug. Please give her lots of them.

- パルスィがかわいすぎて生きていくのが辛い。Protect her always.

- Sometimes I fantasize about Parsee coming home drunk and beating me until I feel numb. She kicks me in the ribs until I can hardly breathe. Then she starts to cry and apologizes, begging me to forgive her. She holds me all night as I gently cry into her leotard. Please help is there any hope for me

- Things I learned about in the course of writing this dialogue:
  - Declension of Sanskrit nouns
  - Persian idioms
  - Zoroastrian demonology
  - The difference between jealousy and envy
  - Indian perfume
  - The history of the Parsis
  - Zoroastrian weddings
  - What grammatical case swearwords are
  - Japanese bathing etiquette
  - Oral sex techniques

(As P. G. Wodehouse once said: "When in due course Charon ferries me across the Styx and everyone is telling everyone else what a rotten writer I was, I hope at least one voice will be heard piping up: 'But he did take trouble.'")

THINGS TO DO:

- The Hashihime Services Menu:

        Take my jealousy away: I'm going to add a jealousy stat (which goes up when you lose Danmaku battles... not sure where else), and you can feed it to Parsee in exchange for favor.

        Help me break up with a lover: This is purely for flavor purposes since IRL hashihimes are invoked for help with breakups.

        Curse someone for me: I plan on changing Parsee's schedule to add a new activity: cursing people between 1 and 3 AM. If you catch her doing it, you can blackmail her into cursing people for you. Since Symposium of Post-Mysticism says that Parsee's curses don't do anything worse than give the target a backache, I plan on having it weaken the target's danmaku abilities for a day (maybe give a level 1 pain mark too?). Maybe you can pay her extra to have her summon the Green-Eyed Monster to help you out?

        I want to have a threesome with you and that clone you summoned in our danmaku battle: Fun with spell cards. You only get this option at all if you see her use either variant of Tongue-Cut Sparrow in a Danmaku match, and she won't do it even then unless she's your lover and/or at Love or Lust.

        This will probably be a giant pain to implement... maybe I can repurpose the mob character generation code to create a Parsee clone and then delete it after ufufu ends? I also want to do something relating back to the gimmick of the original spell card... maybe the clone moans louder than the real Parsee and if you give the real Parsee more orgasms by the end of the ufufu, she gains all the palam/exp/etc. gains from both Parsees, and if you don't, she doesn't get anything?

        I want you to summon that invisible monster again: Parsee summons the Green-Eyed Monster to do stuff for you. I'm not sure what stuff yet, though. I was thinking you could use it to steal panties (plus learn girls' weaknesses if they're masturbating when GEM tries to sneak into their rooms)... could you use it to cheat in the casino, maybe? Although it's easy enough to break the casino by savescumming as is...

- Other ideas for troublemakers:

    - The three fairies try and prank someone by pushing them off

- A Lust Route quest chain where Parsee starts drawing hentai doujins under a pseudonym and has you pose as their author in order to sell them. This would give people a reason to actually do the Lust Route. At some point Patchy will buy some of Parsee's yaoi work in a painfully obvious disguise.

- And of course, content for everything in her dialogue files that doesn't have content yet, and more content for the things that do. (Yes, I do intend to surpass Hatate by the time I'm done with her.)












































You read this far, so here's a snippet from another character I want to work on:

Dammit, enough already!
Momoyo pants as she stares down at you, lust glittering in her eyes.
Maybe \@ IS_YOUKAI(MASTER) ? your people # humans \@ like teasin' and playin' hard to get... but that's not how we oomukade do things.
We get straight to the point and don't beat around the bush.
Now... you obviously wanna fuck me, and I wanna fuck you too.
She places a hand on your leg and starts slowly but steadily moving toward your crotch.
So let's quit screwin' around and get to plain old screwin'HPH

And one more:


All of a sudden, the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. You feel like someone is watching you.
You look around... and see an eyeball. Just an eyeball, floating in the air.
Staring at you.
Then two more pop up next to it. The way they appear makes it look like they're invisible when they were closing their lids.
Two more, hovering below the first pair.
The eyes stare at you. Something about their stare is making your flesh crawl...
And then you realize. They're the same eyeballs that you see inside Yukari's gaps.
You need to get out of here. Now.
You turn to run, but before you can... a bolt of lightning strikes the ground in front of you!
The flash is so bright that you're blinded for a moment.
When your vision returns... there's a woman standing in front of you.
She bows to you and smiles disarmingly. Except it only makes you even more
unnerved.
Her smile... it's on upside-down.
She's isn't frowning or anything.
Her lips just look like they were pulled off her face, rotated 180 degrees, and stuck back on.
"So."
She speaks with an unplaceable accent, and her voice sounds oddly distorted.
"You are the new outsider. From the world of humans."
"We, too, are outsiders. But We do not come from your world. We come from..."
She pauses for a moment. You suddenly notice that her lips haven't been moving the whole time she's been speaking.
"Below. Not from your Hell, or even from Makai. Somewhere else entirely."
"Our true name cannot be pronounced in your tongue, and it would destroy your mind if you tried. But you may call Us YuugenMagan."
"A meeting is nice."
She smiles that upside-down smile again.
"Let us meet again soon."
